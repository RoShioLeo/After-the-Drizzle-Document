# Crop Environment System

**Crop Environment System** is a mechanics added by the *After the Drizzle* Mod,

which is based on [Humid](humid.md#Humid) system, and influences your farming gameplay.

## Description

All crops(except trees added by other mods) get a proper humid level. 

If a certain type of crop is not included in the support list, it gets a default proper humid level: Moderate to Moist.

A crop will grow as it does in Vanilla Minecraft, when it is in its proper humid level.

For each humid level away from the proper humid level, the crop's chance to grow decrease for 50%.

Meanwhile, *After the Drizzle* Mod disables the Bone Meal to accelerate crops' growth.

But Bone Meal is still able to let Tea Plant to bloom and apply on any blocks except crops.
